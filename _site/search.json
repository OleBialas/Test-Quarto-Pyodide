    "text": "1 Storing Data in Variables\nIn the first section, we are going to learn how to represent different kinds of data and store them in variables. We are going to encounter four basic data types: integers, floating-point numbers, Boolean values and text strings. We are also going to use lists which are collections of data. Data can be assigned to a variable using the = operator which takes the value on the right and assigns it to the variable on the left. In this sense, a variable is simply a container that we can use to store and access data. The data type of a variable can be determined with the type() function. We can also convert variables from one type to another - for example, the int() function will try to convert a variable to an integer. Finally, Python provides operators for the arithmetic operations like addition +, subtraction -, multiplication * and division /.
